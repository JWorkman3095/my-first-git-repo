Name: Jeff Workman
Student now in Max Technical Training as of 1/18/2022.
Spent years working in a few different fields: Enetertainment, Retail, Warehousing, Inventory and Manufactoring 
Currently unemployeed but working with two bands and performing acoustic shows until I graduate.
Reason for attending MTT
    I decided I needed a new start after my last job was just that. A job.
    It lacked anything that was motivating to get up on a daily basis.
    The toxic environment was the last staw.
I look forward to gaining the knowledge I need to venture into the programming world.
    It seems exciting and challenging, which suits me just fine.
